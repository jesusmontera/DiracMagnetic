# Dirac-Pauli-Schrod Magnetic Python 3.6 OpenGL QT5
Apply magnetic fields to Dirac equation spinors in python(under construction).
Based on marl0ny Dirac examples from Github.https://github.com/marl0ny/split-operator-simulations 

Each dialog have it's own myxxxx that import and implement functionality to the QT5 designer dialogs.
It can be used but is not finished.

The video is old, the magnetic window have changed, thanks to boiboi from magpylib github forum for help me to make a better and faster magnetic field. Now it can be created from the app, or if u don't have installed magpylib u can load the precreated file BgerlachZ.npy from this repo from the magnetic dialog window menu-file-open
